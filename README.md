## Description

This is a web app running on Nodejs that allows users to create, view, and delete persistent, shared notes stored on the server. The server (created with the `Nodejs express` package) handles a variety of requests both to display the web page and to allow communication between the web page and the server. I was given all of the front-end code (everything in the `public` folder), and I wrote all of the server-side code.

The application is [deployed here](https://johndjake-note-taker.herokuapp.com/).
